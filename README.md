# Interface versioning in C++

This repo aims to provide an executable version of the article [Interface Versioning in C++](https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1718) by Steve Love, also covered in [this talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/1599-interface-versioning-in-c-plus-plus) using [these slides](https://www.slideshare.net/skillsmatter/cpp-ver-talk).

* [ ] Implement all steps of the article as separate versions of a dynamic library and a consuming application
* [ ] Demonstrate described incompatibilities on `properties` classes
* [ ] Demonstrate described incompatibilities by combining and running different combinations of libraries and applications (maybe even compilers and compiler versions) in automated tests. Some should result in runtime errors.
* [ ] Releated topic: [N4028: Defining a Portable C++ ABIâ€”Herb Sutter](https://isocpp.org/blog/2014/05/n4028)


## Situation

A shared library called `inventory` and a client `application` using this library.

## Goal

The goal is that our library can extend its interface, while the client does not have to recompile. Here, extending the interface means adding new methods to a type that is already used by the client.

## Challenge

The C++ standard does not (yet) define an ABI that allows to  

At various points the article comes back to the problem that the layout of vtables depends upon the implementation of the compiler that is used. Also a new version of the same compiler might choose to group the functions in a different way, again resulting in undefined behaviour unless client code recompiles.

## Solution

The premise of the solution the article proposes is that instead of adding methods to an interface which is part of a deployed library, the new methods are added to a new interface.

The key to this working is that the new interface inherits publicly from the existing one.

# Steps towards a downward compatible interface

We follow the changes of the `inventory` library until its interface can be safely extended without forcing the client `application` to recompile.

The quoted text in the following titles refers to sections of the [source article](https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1718).

## Inventory 1.0.0 - "The Goal"

Inventory Interface and Implementation:

    class part                             // start with a concrete class which is visible to the client
        int id()

## Inventory 2.0.0 - "Untying the knot"

Inventory Interface:

    part * create_part( return realpart )  // introduce a factory function
 
    virtual class part                     // introduce an interface class
        virtual int id()

Inventory Implementation:

    class realpart : public part           // hide implementation from client
        int id()


Changes:
* Hide private data in subclass `realpart` which is private to the library `inventory`
* Make pure virtual `part` the public-facing interface of the library
* Add factory function to create new instances

Design Evolution:
* The `part` interface hides all the implementation details from clients, such as data members and private or protected member functions.
* `realpart` can change in any way, as long as it correctly implements the `part` interface, without requiring any recompilation on the part of clients.

Compatibility Impact:
* The inventory library breaks its API
* The client application must change code and recompile


## Inventory 3.0.0 - "False hope"

Inventory Interface:

    part * create_part( return realpart )

    virtual class part
        virtual int id()
        virtual string name()              // add interface method

Inventory Implementation:

    class realpart : pulic part
        int id()
        string name()                      // add method implementation


Changes:
* A new method has been added to the public interface of our library.

Design Evolution:
* Not really, just another method.

Compatibility Impact:
* Even though the client code doesn't use the new method, it must recompile against the new interface definition, and still needs to re-deploy at the same time as the new library is deployed.
* The reason is that we can't (shouldn't) make assumptions about the order of extended vtables.


## Inventory 4.0.0 - "Extending interfaces and a wrong turn"

Inventory Interface:

    part * create_part( return realpart )
    
    virtual class part  
        virtual int id()
        virtual string name()

    virtual class part_v2 : public part    // add a new interface class, inheriting from the existing one
        virtual void id(int)  
        virtual void name(string)  

Inventory Implementation:

    class realpart : public part_v2        // implement new interface class
        int id()                           // implement part interface
        string name()
        id(int)                            // implement part_v2 interface
        name(string)

Changes:
* Add setter methods to interface
* Do so by adding a second abstract interface class inheriting from the existing one.
* A single class implements the second abstract interface class

Design Evolution:
* The interface is formed by an inheritance structure of pure virtual classes.

Compatibility Impact:
* The problem is not the interface.
* The problem is the implementation. The order of the methods in the implementation's vtable still depends on the compiler.
* A client using the part_v2 interface will be able to work with a realpart instance. But we can't guarantee that a client using the part interface to use a realpart instance will call the correct entry points.

## Inventory 5.0.0 - Splitting the implementation

Inventory Interface:

    part * create_part( return realpart_v2 )
    
    virtual class part  
        virtual int id()
        virtual string name()

    virtual class part_v2 : public part  
        virtual void id(int)  
        virtual void name(string)  

Inventory Implementation:

    class realpart : public part           // reintroducing the "part" implementation
        int id()
        string name()

    class realpart_v2 : public part_v2
        int id()
        string name()
        id(int)
        name(string)

Changes:

Design Evolution:

Compatibility Impact:
* It's still not portable however. The code for realpart_v2 is still dependent upon the implementation specific behaviour of the compiler in laying out the vtable this way. A new version of the same compiler might choose to group the functions in a different way, again resulting in undefined behaviour unless client code recompiles.

## "Virtually done"... everything is diamond

Inventory Interface:

    part * create_part( return realpart_v2 )
    
    virtual class part  
        virtual int id()
        virtual string name()

    virtual class part_v2 : public part  
        virtual void id(int)  
        virtual void name(string)  

Inventory Implementation:

    class realpart : public part
        int id()
        string name()

    class realpart_v2 : public part_v2, public realpart           // inherit those two methods from realpart
        id(int)
        name(string)

Changes:
* The realpart_v2 class uses implementation inheritance to bring in the pure-virtual declarations and implementations of the part interface, and with using declarations brings those names into scope to allow them to be overloaded with the new, setter, functions. Finally, the factory function create_part is changed to return an instance of the new implementing class.

(?) should't the factory have been changed in the previous step?

Design Evolution:

Compatibility Impact:

## "Ambiguity banishment"

Inventory Interface:

    part * create_part( return realpart_v2 )
    
    virtual class part  
        virtual int id()
        virtual string name()

    virtual class part_v2 : public virtual part                   // inherit virtually from interface class
        virtual void id(int)  
        virtual void name(string)  

Inventory Implementation:

    class realpart : public virtual part                          // inherit virtually from interface class
        int id()
        string name()

    class realpart_v2 : public virtual part_v2, public realpart   // inherit virtually from interface class
        id(int)
        name(string)

Changes:

## "Finishing polish"
